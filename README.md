# Quizpert - Smarter Quizzes for Sharper Hiring

See the [SRS](docs/Quizpert_SRS.md) for more details on the project.

## Description

**Quizpert** is a streamlined, professional-grade tool designed to help recruiters and hiring teams manage technical quizzes during the interview process. Rather than trying to replace the entire recruitment workflow, **Quizpert focuses solely on what matters most in early candidate evaluation**: smart, structured, and consistent quiz-based assessments.

With Quizpert, companies can create, assign, and evaluate multiple-choice quizzes to better gauge candidates' technical knowledge before moving forward in the interview pipeline. From question banks to result analysis, everything is centralized, easy to manage, and purpose-built for interview rounds.

Whether you're hiring engineers, designers, analysts, or other technical roles â€” Quizpert turns casual quiz sessions into meaningful evaluation data.

> Quizpert is not a full recruitment or applicant tracking system. It specializes exclusively in **interview-related quiz management**.

## Key Features

  Only recruiters and hiring managers can create and manage users, ensuring full control over who accesses and submits assessments.

  Get per-question breakdowns, answer logs, and scoring insights to support hiring decisions and reporting.
